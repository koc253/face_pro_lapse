Face Pro Lapse - Selfie Timelapse
==================================

Yep, made something for selfies. Shoot me.

Face Pro Lapse is a python script to detect faces in images and align them based on the largest face position. It then creates a video of the images. Useful for making a video from holiday pictures.

Put your images in ./images

Set the output image size, the scaling, the framerate and the position that you want the faces to align in the file.

If the face isn't found a selection window will appear. Draw a box around the face and press "ESC" when you're happy.

YOLO :-/
