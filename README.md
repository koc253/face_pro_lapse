FaceLapse - Selfie Timelapse
==================================

Yep, made something for selfies. Shoot me.

Face Lapse Pro is a python script to detect faces in images and align them based on the largest face position. It then creates a video of the images. Useful for making a video from holiday pictures.

Put your images in ./images

Set the output image size, the desired face size and the framerate in the main method. (fps, faceHeight, videoSize)

If the face isn't found a selection window will appear if the manualMode variable is set True. Draw a box around the face and press "a" when you're happy or "ESC" to skip that image.

YOLO :-/
